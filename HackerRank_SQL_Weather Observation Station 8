Query the list of CITY names from STATION which have vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, and u) as both their first and last characters. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

The STATION table is described as follows

--STATION_TABLE
Field           |     Type
ID              |    NUMBER
CITY            |    VARCHAR2(21)
STATE           |    VARCHAR2(2)
LAT_N           |    NUMBER
LONG_W          |    NUMBER


--Answer
SELECT DISTINCT CITY
  FROM STATION
  WHERE SUBSTR(CITY,1,1) IN ('A','E','I','O','U')
    AND SUBSTR(CITY,-1,1) IN ('a','e','i','o','u');
