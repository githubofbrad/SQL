Query the Name of any student in STUDENTS who scored higher than  Marks. Order your output by the last three characters of each name. 
If two or more students both have names ending in the same last three characters (i.e.: Bobby, Robby, etc.), secondary sort them by ascending ID.

The STUDENTS table is described as follows:

--STUDENTS TABLE
Field           |     Type
ID              |    INTEGRAL
NAME            |    STRING
Marks           |    INTEGER



--ANSWER
SELECT NAME
  FROM STUDENTS
  WHERE MARKS > 75
  ORDER BY SUBSTR(NAME,-3), ID;
