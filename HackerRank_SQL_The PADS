Generate the following two result sets:

Query an alphabetically ordered list of all names in OCCUPATIONS, immediately followed by the first letter of each profession as a parenthetical (i.e.: enclosed in parentheses). For example: AnActorName(A), ADoctorName(D), AProfessorName(P), and ASingerName(S).
Query the number of ocurrences of each occupation in OCCUPATIONS. Sort the occurrences in ascending order, and output them in the following format:

 >>  There are a total of [occupation_count] [occupation]s.  <<
 
 where [occupation_count] is the number of occurrences of an occupation in OCCUPATIONS and [occupation] is the lowercase occupation name.
 If more than one Occupation has the same [occupation_count], they should be ordered alphabetically.
*Note: There will be at least two entries in the table for each type of occupation.


--OCCUPATIONS TABLE
NAME                    |     STRING
Occupation              |    STRING



--ANSWER
SELECT NAME || '(' || SUBSTR(OCCUPATION,1,1) || ')'
  FROM OCCUPATIONS
  ORDER BY NAME;
  
SELECT 'There are a total of ' || count(occupation) || ' ' || lower(occupation) || 's.'
  FROM OCCUPATIONS
  group by occupation
  order by count(occupation), occupation;
