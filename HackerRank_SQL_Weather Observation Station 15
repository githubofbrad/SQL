Query the Western Longitude (LONG_W) for the largest Northern Latitude (LAT_N) in STATION that is less than 137.2345 . Round your answer to  decimal places.

The STATION table is described as follows:

--STATION_TABLE
Field           |     Type
ID              |    NUMBER
CITY            |    VARCHAR2(21)
STATE           |    VARCHAR2(2)
LAT_N           |    NUMBER
LONG_W          |    NUMBER


--ANSWER
 SELECT ROUND(LONG_W,4)
   FROM ( SELECT *
            FROM STATION
           WHERE LAT_N < 137.2345
           ORDER BY LAT_N DESC
         )
  WHERE ROWNUM = 1;
